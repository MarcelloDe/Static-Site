I"æ<p>In the month of April 2022 I was just finishing up my second semester of my Software Development program and with summer coming up I applied to various internship positions. Having previous Data Science experience, I was selected to complete a take-home assignment as part of the interview process for the position of â€˜Data Analyst Internâ€™. <b> This is a record of what the assignment entailed, the questions it asked, and my answers that landed me the position <b>.</b></b></p>
